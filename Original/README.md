JARVAS (Just A Rather Very Average System) is an indoor positioning system, in which a wearable tag communicates with multiple stationary anchors to determine its position.

## How to Build It

Our primary documentation for how to re-create our setup lives on [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/JARVAS-Indoor-Positioning-System/).

## Source Files

All of our source files (including software, PCB design files, and MATLAB simulation code) live in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dddutz/jarvas-indoor-positioning-system/).

## Technical Details

This website documents some of the more interesting technical aspects of the project. If you're looking to modify, extend, or get inspiration from what we did, read on.

##CALIBRATION IS IMPORTANT!

1. Make sure you know which anchors have which addresses.
2. Set CALIBRATION_FIRST to true.
3. Place each anchor 2 meters away from the tag. Make sure to keep anchors away from each other as much as possible.
4. Record each of the anchor's distance values, and record them in BEACON_N_FIRSTDIST.
5. Repeat this process, but at 5 meters away from each tag, and recording in BEACON_N_SECONDDIST.
5. Set CALIBRATION_FIRST to false.
6. Your tag is now calibrated!

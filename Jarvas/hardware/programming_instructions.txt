Programming the SparkFun Caterina bootloader onto an Atmega32U4

This process probably needs to be optimized and refined, but the following appears to work. This was tested on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04), but should be portable to any platform.

If you are using a part other than the Atmega32U4 or a clock frequency other than 8 MHz, be sure to follow the instructions to download the correct firmware and find the correct fuse settings. If you are using a programmer other than the AVR JTAGICE3, be sure to update the "-cjtag3isp" argument.

*** Permissions ***

For Linux:
Create /etc/udev/rules.d/98-local-jtagice3.rules with the following line:
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2140", GROUP="dialout"

*** Firmware ***

Get the firmware from here: https://github.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Boards/tree/master/sparkfun/avr/bootloaders/caterina
The correct one for an 8MHz Atmega32U4 is Caterina-promicro8.hex
The program.txt file has the fuse bit settings you need

*** Programming ***

Step 0: Read fuses to file
(This isn't technically necessary, but it's good just to confirm that you can talk to the chip.)
avrdude -v -pm32u4 -cjtag3isp -Pusb -B22 -U efuse:r:efuse.hex:h -U hfuse:r:hfuse.hex:h -U lfuse:r:lfuse.hex:h

Output should end with:
-----------------------------------------------------
avrdude: safemode: hfuse reads as 99
avrdude: safemode: efuse reads as F3
avrdude: safemode: Fuses OK (E:F3, H:99, L:5E)

avrdude done.  Thank you.
-----------------------------------------------------

It will also create three files in your working directory (efuse.hex, hfuse.hex, and lfuse.hex) that contain the current fuse settings. See fuse_bits_example/before for example output of this command before you configure the fuses in Step 1 (below) and fuse_bits_example/after for what you should have after Step 1.

Step 1:
avrdude -v -pm32u4 -cjtag3isp -Pusb -B22 -U flash:w:Caterina-promicro8.hex -U hfuse:w:0xd8:m -U lfuse:w:0xff:m -U efuse:w:0xfe:m
Answer 'y' at the prompt. Don't worry if it says the efuse could not be changed.

That's it!
